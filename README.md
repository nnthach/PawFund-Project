# üåü Welcome to Furry Friends Haven

This is my very first project, and I am incredibly proud of how it turned out! While it‚Äôs not perfect, completing this project marks my first experience with **React**, and I‚Äôm thrilled with the progress I‚Äôve made.

This project represents an important milestone in my learning journey. I plan to continue improving it and adding new features in the future.

Thank you for checking it out, and I hope you enjoy the project as much as I enjoyed building it! üòä

## üéØ Project Purpose

Our mission is to connect homeless pets with loving families while promoting responsible pet adoption.

This project provides users the opportunity to adopt pets for free, giving abandoned and homeless pets a chance at a better life.

In addition, users can donate through VNPay to support our pet charity fund. These donations help us continue rescuing and caring for animals in need.

## üîÑ Main Flow of the Project

Below is an overview of the pet adoption process to ensure a safe and efficient experience for both users and pets.

1. **User Login**:  
   Users must log in to access the adoption features and begin the application process.

2. **Adoption Application**:  
   Users fill out an application form, providing personal information and their home address.

3. **Admin Review**:  
   Once submitted, the application is reviewed by the admin. Pending applications are placed in a queue for approval.

4. **Task Creation for Volunteers**:  
   Approved applications are turned into tasks for volunteers. Volunteers can pick tasks they are able to perform.

5. **Volunteer Home Assessment**:  
   Volunteers visit the applicant's home to assess the living environment for the pet. They evaluate based on specific criteria and submit a report.

6. **Admin Decision**:  
   Based on the volunteer's assessment report and score, the admin decides whether to approve or reject the adoption application.

This workflow ensures that every pet is placed in a safe and caring environment, and it provides transparency and accountability throughout the adoption process.
